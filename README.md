### **Setup Instructions**

#### **1. Clone the Repository**
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
```

#### **2. Install Dependencies**
Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```
Install required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **3. Configure Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the project directory:
```makefile
IMAP_SERVER=imap.gmail.com
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password
```
Enable IMAP on Gmail:
- Go to Gmail settings â†’ Forwarding and POP/IMAP.
- Enable IMAP access.

Generate an App Password:
- Visit Google App Passwords.
- Generate a password for "Mail" and "Windows" and use it in the `EMAIL_PASS` field.

#### **4. Run the Script**
Run the script manually to ensure it works:
```bash
python reminder_service.py
```
The script will check your Gmail inbox every minute for new emails. Notifications will appear for unread emails.

#### **5. Make It a Background Windows Service**

##### **Using a .bat File**
Create a file named `start_service.bat` in the project directory. Add the following content:
```bat
@echo off
pythonw "C:\path\to\your\project\reminder_service.py"
exit
```
Replace `C:\path\to\your\project\reminder_service.py` with the full path to your Python script.

**How to Use:**
- Double-click `start_service.bat` to run the script in the background.
- Notifications will start appearing as per the schedule.

##### **Using a .vbs File**
Create a file named `start_service.vbs` in the project directory. Add the following content:
```vbscript
Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
WshShell.Run "C:\path\to\your\project\start_service.bat", 0
```
Replace `C:\path\to\your\project\start_service.bat` with the full path to your `.bat` file.

**How to Use:**
- Double-click `start_service.vbs` to run the `.bat` file invisibly.
- This ensures the script runs silently in the background.
